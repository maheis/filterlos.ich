## [Unreleased]

## [0.7.0] - 2026-09-22

### Fixed
- A failing tool produced `Error executing tool: <e>`, a wording no other backend used and which `llm_claude` could not recognize as a failure, so a history built here and replayed against Anthropic lost its error flag. It now matches `llm_core`: `Tool <name> failed: <e>`.
- Tool result messages carried no tool name at all, leaving Gemini's `function_result.name` empty.

### Added
- Tool results carry `LLMMessage.toolName` and `LLMMessage.toolResult`.

### Changed
- All packages bumped to `0.7.0`; `llm_core` constraint updated to `^0.7.0`.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-09-17

### Changed
- Version alignment with llm_core 0.6.0.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-09-11

### Fixed
- Streamed chunks never carried a finish reason at all, so `LLMChunk.finishReason` was always null and `chatResponse` fabricated `stop`. A turn that collected tool calls now reports `LLMFinishReason.toolCalls`. The backend still cannot distinguish `stop` from `length` — the isolate reports token counts only.

### Changed
- A turn that ends while carrying complete tool calls now reports `LLMFinishReason.toolCalls`, whatever the provider spelled. The OpenAI specification defines `finish_reason` as `tool_calls` "if the model called a tool", and providers violate it routinely. Code branching on `LLMFinishReason.stop` for a tool-calling turn must move to `toolCalls`. `length`, `contentFilter` and `refusal` are never reclassified: a truncated call is not executable, and a declined turn must stay visibly declined.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-08-30

### Fixed
- Tool calls that take no arguments always failed, via the shared `llm_core` fix: decoding empty arguments as JSON threw, so a zero-parameter tool reported `Tool x failed: FormatException`.

### Changed
- Version bumped to `0.4.0` in lockstep with the other packages, and the `llm_core` constraint raised to `^0.4.0`. No other changes to this package: tool calls are parsed out of raw model output after generation, so there is nothing to stream incrementally.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-08-18

### Added
- `LlamaCppChatRepository.stopTokens` for models whose turn-end marker the GGUF does not flag as end-of-generation. These are additional: the markers implied by the model's own chat template are still detected and appended, so ChatML and Llama 3.x keep working with the default empty list. Set it for a template that is not detected, e.g. Gemma's `<end_of_turn>` or Phi-3's `<|end|>`. Thanks @drawing (#3).

### Fixed
- The package no longer declares itself a Flutter plugin. It declared `ffiPlugin: true` for five platforms while shipping a platform directory for only two, so a consuming app failed to build: CocoaPods could not find a podspec for macOS or iOS, and Linux CMake could not `add_subdirectory`. The native libraries have been code assets from `hook/build.dart` for several releases, and Flutter installs those through its own build step with no dependency manager involved, so the declarations bought nothing. Reported by @drawing for macOS (#1).
- Removed the `android/` and `windows/` plugin stubs the declarations existed for. The Android one had already been reduced to `jniLibs.srcDirs = []`, and the Windows one still tried to install a `libs/llama.dll` that no longer exists.
- `hook/build.dart` read `input.config.code` without first checking `input.config.buildCodeAssets`, so any hook invocation that did not ask for code assets — `flutter run -d macos --debug` makes one once the app is up — failed with `Bad state: HookConfig.code should only be accessed when building code assets` and "Building native assets failed". The hook now emits no assets for those invocations. Pre-existing and unrelated to the plugin declarations above.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-08-18

### Added
- Model-aware tool calling. Tool definitions are advertised in the format the loaded model's family was trained on, and calls are parsed back out of the raw token stream: LFM2/LFM2.5, Hermes/Qwen, Mistral, Llama 3.x, bare Pythonic and bare JSON. See `lib/src/tool_calls/tool_call_syntax.dart` to add a family.
- The family is resolved from the GGUF chat template, falling back to a tokenizer-vocabulary probe. The probe is what makes LFM2.5 work: its GGUF ships a trimmed template that never emits the call delimiters, but the model emits them anyway.
- The example app renders each tool call as a subdued thinking bubble showing the call and its result.

### Fixed
- Tool calling stopped working after the first turn. Callers must replay `LLMChunkMessage.rawContent` into history so the assistant turn keeps its tool-call markup; the example app now does.
- `LlamaCppChatRepository` accepted `tools` but never told the model they existed. The package injects the tool list itself.
- Tool calls no longer leak into user-visible text as raw delimiters, including when a delimiter is split across tokens.
- A single `<tool_call>{...}</tool_call>` no longer yields the same call twice; parsing is delimiter-first and deduplicated.
- The JSON object scanner is string-aware, so braces inside a string argument no longer unbalance it.
- Desktop builds bundled only `libllama`, not the `ggml` libraries it links against. An app worked on the machine that built it and broke as soon as it moved.
- The macOS Flutter loader opened `libllama.dylib`, which is never in the app bundle. It now opens `@rpath/llama.framework/llama`.
- `hook/build.dart` declares the FFI bindings as a hook dependency, without which regenerated bindings never invalidated the prebuilt cache.
- Prebuilt bundles are cached under `outputDirectoryShared`, so a bundle downloads once rather than once per target.
- CMake configuration disables `LLAMA_BUILD_APP`, `LLAMA_BUILD_COMMON` and `LLAMA_BUILD_UI`; upstream's unified `app` target broke the source build.
- `ffigen.yaml` no longer carries a hardcoded absolute include path from another machine.
- The example app's `CalculatorTool` no longer echoes integral operands as floats, and its history window snaps to a user message instead of slicing into a tool exchange.
- The default HTTP client is now `createLLMHttpClient()`, which applies `TimeoutConfig.connectionTimeout` and bounds the connection pool.

### Changed
- Native-assets toolchain migrated off 1.x: `hooks ^2.0.0`, `code_assets ^1.2.1`, `ffigen ^21.0.0`.
- `llamacpp` submodule updated to current upstream, vendored `src/include/` headers re-synced, FFI bindings regenerated, and the stale third `src/llama.h` copy removed.
- Migrated off deprecated llama.cpp entry points (`llama_load_model_from_file`, `llama_n_vocab`, the `llama_n_*` model getters and friends) to their modern equivalents.
- `LoraManager` reimplemented on upstream's declarative `llama_set_adapters_lora`. `applyLora`, `removeLora`, `clearLoras` and `switchLora` keep their signatures; added `activeLoras(ctx)` and `forgetContext(ctx)` — call the latter before freeing a context.
- `ModelLoadOptions.useMemoryMap` / `useMemoryLock` now map onto upstream's `load_mode` enum.
- Documentation corrected: the prompt-template classes (`ChatMLTemplate` and friends) were removed in 0.1.5. Templates come from the GGUF via `llama_chat_apply_template()`.
- The prebuilt native bundle's version is read from `pubspec.yaml` instead of a hand-maintained constant, and `.github/workflows/build-release.yaml` reads the same field — so bumping the package version is what builds and points at a matching native release. Previously the constant said `0.4.0` while the package was `0.3.0`, and no such release existed.
- Native release tags are bare versions (`0.3.1`) rather than `v`-prefixed. The hook downloads from `releases/download/<version>/`, and the release workflow creates that tag itself; pushing a tag no longer triggers anything.
- The Vulkan-enabled release builds (Linux x64, Windows x64, Android arm64-v8a) now install SPIRV-Headers, which current upstream `ggml-vulkan` requires via `find_package(SPIRV-Headers CONFIG REQUIRED)`. Android additionally passes `SPIRV-Headers_DIR` and `CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PACKAGE=BOTH`, because the NDK toolchain otherwise restricts `find_package` to the NDK sysroot. Windows tracks upstream's Vulkan SDK 1.4.357.0; 1.3.290.0 shipped no SPIRV-Headers config.
- The hook's Android Vulkan gate also requires a discoverable SPIRV-Headers config, so a machine with `glslc` but without the headers falls back to a CPU-only build instead of failing the CMake configure. `SPIRV_HEADERS_DIR` overrides the search.
- Documentation rewritten for the current build: there is no manual native-library step, no workflow to run by hand, and nothing to copy into `jniLibs`.
- Dependency floors raised: Dart SDK `^3.12.0` (was `^3.8.0`), `http ^1.6.0`, `lints ^6.1.0`, `test ^1.31.0`. Flutter floor raised to `>=3.44.0`.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-08-17

### Changed
- Version alignment with `llm_core` 0.3.0 (`ReasoningEffort` available through
  the re-export); no functional changes.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-12

### Changed
- **Breaking:** Adopted `LLMChatOptions?` in chat APIs.
- Explicit empty tool lists now clear inherited tool options.
- Local tool loops now respect `autoExecuteTools: false`.

### Added
- Structured output support via `StreamChatOptions.responseFormat`:
  - `JsonFormat()` — injects a "respond with valid JSON only" instruction into the system message
  - `JsonSchemaFormat(name, schema)` — injects the JSON Schema into the system message
  - If no system message exists, one is prepended; otherwise the instruction is appended to the existing system message
  - `responseFormat` is propagated through tool-call loops so format constraints are preserved across all turns
- `injectResponseFormat(messages, format)` package-private helper function; unit-testable standalone
- Bumped `llm_core` dependency to `^0.2.0`

### Fixed
- Android hosted-package builds now rely on the native-assets hook instead of Gradle invoking repository-local build scripts, and the Android native asset bundle includes the required llama.cpp runtime `.so` dependencies.

## [0.1.9] - 2026-02-28

### Changed
- `maxToolAttempts` default increased from 25 to 90
- Bumped `llm_core` dependency to ^0.1.9

## [0.1.8] - 2026-02-26

### Changed
- Bumped `llm_core` dependency to ^0.1.8 for tool calling stream visibility

## [0.1.7] - 2026-02-10

### Added
- `batchEmbed()` implementation: delegates to existing `embed()` (processes multiple messages in the embedding isolate).

## [0.1.6] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed
- Confirmed that parsed tool calls from llama.cpp outputs always include non-null, non-empty `LLMToolCall.id` values across supported formats (JSON, XML-style, and function-style), maintaining compatibility with `llm_core` tool-calling expectations.
- Added tests for `ToolCallParser` to verify that tool call IDs are populated correctly for downstream `toolCallId` usage.
